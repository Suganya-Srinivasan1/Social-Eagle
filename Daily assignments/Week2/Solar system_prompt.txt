A hyper-maximalist solar system masterpiece, 
Planets connected by translucent, shimmering orbital threads,
planets rendered as follows
Sun as a pulsating golden heart with solar flares shaped like flower petals,
Planets connected by translucent, shimmering orbital threads. Mercury A cratered, airless world with extreme temperature swings,
Venus A hellish environment with a runaway greenhouse effect and a thick, toxic atmosphere,
Earth The only known planet with liquid surface water and life,
Mars The "Red Planet," home to the largest volcano (Olympus Mons) and a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere,
Jupiter The largest planet, featuring a massive magnetic field and the iconic Great Red Spot storm,
Saturn's rings rendered as iridescent crystalline shards,
Uranus A methane-rich planet that rotates on its side, likely due to an ancient massive collision, 
Neptune The windiest planet in the system, appearing deep blue due to methane in its atmosphere,
faint trail of stardust weaving between the celestial bodies
planets rendered as intricate spheres of liquid glass and precious metals, the Sun at the center as a roaring core 
of white-hot filigree, orbital paths visualized as glowing golden threads woven into a sacred geometry pattern, deep teal and violet nebula background with micro-star clusters, cinematic lighting, 8k resolution, ethereal atmosphere, style of Peter Mohrbacher and dynamic cosmic futurism."
